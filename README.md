# Scalable AI/ML Infrastructure Deployment on AWS

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a cost-effective, scalable, and secure AI/ML infrastructure using AWS services. The project features enterprise-grade ML operations with advanced LLM integration, containerized deployment, and auto-scaling capabilities.

## Business Challenge

**Scenario**: A fintech company's support team receives thousands of long customer service tickets monthly, leading to:
- High average handling time (AHT) for resolving cases
- Inconsistent triage of tickets, increasing errors and escalations
- Inefficient knowledge access with important details buried in conversations

**Solution**: Deploy an enterprise AI/ML platform with AWS Bedrock LLM integration, automated ML pipelines, and real-time analytics to reduce AHT, improve accuracy, and enforce strong DevSecOps practices.

## Next Steps: Future Enhancements

### 🔧 Immediate TODOs (Current Issues to Address)

> **Note**: Application currently running on Docker Desktop locally. Full cloud migration planned.

#### **Solution 1: Fix Bedrock Access** 🔑
- [ ] Enable Bedrock model access in AWS Console:
  - Go to AWS Bedrock Console → Model access
  - Request access to Claude models (Anthropic)
  - Enable the models you want to use
- [ ] Alternative: Use a different model that you have access to, or request access from your AWS administrator

#### **Solution 2: Fix Text Summarizer** 🛠️
- [ ] Connect text summarizer to real AI service (currently using mock data)
- [ ] Options to consider:
  - Connect to AWS Bedrock (after fixing access above)
  - Integrate with OpenAI API
  - Connect to Hugging Face models
  - Keep as demo with better realistic data

### Planned Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery
- [ ] Enhanced MLOps with Kubeflow integration
- [ ] Advanced A/B testing framework for ML models
- [ ] Real-time data streaming with Kinesis
- [ ] Edge deployment for low-latency inference
- [ ] **Full cloud migration** (currently running locally on Docker Desktop)

### DevSecOps Enhancements
- [ ] Automated security scanning with Snyk
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- [ ] GitOps deployment with ArgoCD
- [ ] Chaos engineering with AWS Fault Injection Simulator
- [ ] Advanced observability with AWS X-Ray
